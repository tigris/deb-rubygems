The debian specific control files and doc filler was all ninjad from the
existing rubygems-1.3.5 deb package.

To build this bad boy, you you need to do is copy this folder into your
rubygems-1.3.* extracted tarball folder and name it 'deb', then

  make -f deb/Makefile clean
  make -f deb/Makefile all

Your deb file will be at deb/rubygems1.9.1-1.3.*.deb
